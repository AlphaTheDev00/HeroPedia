### üë§ User Stories
I developed the following user stories to guide the development process:
- As a user, I want to create an account so that I can access the platform
- As a user, I want to log in to my account to manage my content
- As a user, I want to create posts with images to share with others
- As a user, I want to view all my posts in one place
- As a user, I want to edit or delete my posts
- As a user, I want to browse posts from other users
- As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it

### üìà Project Management
I used Trello to organize tasks and track progress throughout the development cycle:

## üî® Build/Code Process

### üîê Authentication System
One of the first components I built was the authentication system. I implemented user registration, login, and password reset functionality:

```javascript
// User registration route
router.post('/register', guestRoute, async (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  try {
    const userExists = await User.findOne({ email });

    if (userExists) {
      req.flash('error', 'User already exists with this email!');
      return res.redirect('/register');
    }

    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);

    const user = new User({
      name,
      email,
      password: hashedPassword,
    });

    await user.save();
    req.flash('success', 'User registered successfully, you can login now!');
    res.redirect('/login');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    req.flash('error', 'Something went wrong, try again!');
    res.redirect('/register');
  }
});
```

For the password reset functionality, I implemented a token-based system using Nodemailer:

```javascript
// Forgot password route
router.post('/forgot-password', async (req, res) => {
  const { email } = req.body;
  try {
    const user = await User.findOne({ email });
    if (!user) {
      req.flash('error', 'User not found with this email');
      return res.redirect('/forgot-password');
    }
    const token = Math.random().toString(36).slice(2);
    user.token = token;
    await user.save();
    const info = await transport.sendMail({
      from: '"HeroPedia" <fordev77@gmail.com>',
      to: email,
      subject: 'Password Reset',
      text: 'Reset your password',
      html: `<p>Click this link to reset your password: <a href="${process.env.APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'}/reset-password/${token}">Reset Password</a><br>Thank you!</p>`,
    });

    if (info.messageId) {
      req.flash('success', 'Password reset link has been sent to your email!');
      res.redirect('/forgot-password');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    req.flash('error', 'Something went wrong, try again!');
    res.redirect('/forgot-password');
  }
});
```

### üìù Post Management System
The core functionality of the application is the post management system. I implemented CRUD operations for posts, including image uploads using Multer:

```javascript
// Create post route
router.post(
  '/create-post',
  protectedRoute,
  upload.single('image'),
  async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const { title, content } = req.body;
      const slug = title.replace(/\s+/g, '-').toLowerCase();
      const user = await User.findById(req.session.user._id);
      
      // Check if file was uploaded
      if (!req.file) {
        req.flash('error', 'Image is required!');
        return res.redirect('/create-post');
      }
      
      const image = req.file.buffer.toString('base64');

      // Create new post
      const post = new Post({ title, slug, content, image, user });

      // Save post in user posts array
      await User.updateOne(
        { _id: req.session.user._id },
        { $push: { posts: post._id } }
      );
      await post.save();
      req.flash('success', 'Post created successfully!');
      res.redirect('/my-posts');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      req.flash('error', 'Something went wrong!');
      res.redirect('/create-post');
    }
  }
);
```

For image handling, I used Multer's memory storage to store images as base64 strings in the database:

```javascript
// Initialize upload variable with the storage engine
const upload = multer({
  storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 1 * 1024 * 1024 }, // Limit file size to 1MB
});
```

### Middleware Implementation
I created middleware functions to protect routes and manage user sessions:

```javascript
// Protect routes middleware function
export const protectedRoute = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.session.user) {
    return res.redirect('/login');
  }
  next();
};

// Guest routes middleware function
export const guestRoute = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.session.user) {
    return res.redirect('/profile');
  }
  next();
};
```

### Frontend Development
For the frontend, I used EJS templates with Bootstrap 5 to create a responsive design. Here's an example of the home page template:

```html
<%- include('partials/header') %>
<div class="container my-4">
  <div class="row g-4">
    <% if (posts && posts.length > 0) { %> <% posts.forEach(post => { %>
    <div class="col-lg-6">
      <div class="card shadow">
        <img
          src="data:image/jpeg;base64,<%= post.image %>"
          class="img-fluid card-img-top"
          alt="wallpaper"
        />
        <div class="card-body p-4">
          <h2 class="card-title fw-bold text-secondary"><%= post.title %></h2>
          <p class="card-text"><%= post.content.substring(0, 100) %>...</p>
          <div>
            <a href="/post/<%= post._id %>" class="btn btn-primary"
              >Read More</a
            >
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="card-footer">
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
            <div>Author: <%= post.user.name %></div>
            <div>
              Created: <%= new Date(post.createdAt).toLocaleDateString() %>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <% }); %> <% } else { %>
    <p>No posts available at this time.</p>
    <% } %>
  </div>
</div>
<%- include('partials/footer') %>
```

### üìç Deployment Configuration
For deployment to Netlify, I configured serverless functions:

```javascript
// netlify/functions/api.js
import express from 'express';
import connectDB from '../../db.js';
import authRoutes from '../../routes/authRoutes.js';
import postRoutes from '../../routes/postRoutes.js';
import cookieParser from 'cookie-parser';
import session from 'express-session';
import flash from 'connect-flash';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import path from 'path';
import MongoStore from 'connect-mongo';
import serverless from 'serverless-http';
import methodOverride from 'method-override';

const app = express();
dotenv.config();

connectDB();

// middlewares
app.use(methodOverride('_method'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

// make uploads directory as static
app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(process.cwd(), 'public')));

// cookie middleware
app.use(cookieParser(process.env.COOKIE_SECRET));

// session middleware
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      maxAge: 60000 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 1Week
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    },
    store: MongoStore.create({
      mongoUrl: process.env.MONGO_DB_URI,
      collectionName: 'sessions',
    }),
  })
);

// flash messages middleware
app.use(flash());

// store flash message for views
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.locals.message = req.flash();
  next();
});

// store authenticated user's sessions data for view
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.locals.user = req.session.user || null;
  next();
});

//set template engine to ejs
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// auth route
app.use('/', authRoutes);

// post routes
app.use('/', postRoutes);

export const handler = serverless(app);
```

## üí• Challenges

### üì∑ Image Upload and Storage
One of the significant challenges was implementing image upload functionality. Initially, I planned to use a cloud storage service like AWS S3, but due to time constraints, I opted for storing images as base64 strings in the MongoDB database. This approach had limitations with larger files, so I implemented file size and type restrictions using Multer:

```javascript
// File filter to allow only JPEG
const fileFilter = (req, file, cb) => {
  if (file.mimetype === 'image/jpeg') {
    cb(null, true); // Accept the file
  } else {
    cb(new Error('Only JPEG files are allowed!'), false); // Reject the file
  }
};

// Initialize upload variable with the storage engine
const upload = multer({
  storage: multer.memoryStorage(),
  fileFilter: fileFilter,
  limits: { fileSize: 1 * 1024 * 1024 }, // Limit file size to 1MB
});
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
Implementing comprehensive error handling was challenging but crucial for a good user experience. I used try-catch blocks and flash messages to provide feedback to users:

```javascript
try {
  // Code that might throw an error
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
  req.flash('error', 'Something went wrong, try again!');
  res.redirect('/appropriate-route');
}
```

### üîí Session Management
Managing user sessions across the application required careful implementation, especially when deploying to Netlify. I had to configure the session store to use MongoDB:

```javascript
app.use(
  session({
    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      maxAge: 60000 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 1Week
      httpOnly: true,
      secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    },
    store: MongoStore.create({
      mongoUrl: process.env.MONGO_DB_URI,
      collectionName: 'sessions',
    }),
  })
);
```

## üéâ Wins

### üì± Responsive Design
I'm particularly proud of the responsive design implementation using Bootstrap 5. The application looks and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices, providing a consistent user experience across platforms.

### üîÑ Password Reset Functionality
Implementing a complete password reset flow with email notifications was a significant achievement. This feature enhances the security and usability of the application.

### ‚úÖ Image Upload Validation
The image upload system with validation for file types and sizes was a technical win. It ensures that only appropriate content is uploaded to the platform and prevents potential issues with large files.

### üí¨ Flash Messages
The implementation of flash messages throughout the application provides immediate feedback to users, enhancing the overall user experience:

```javascript
// Flash message middleware
app.use(flash());

// Store flash message for views
app.use(function (req, res, next) {
  res.locals.message = req.flash();
  next();
});
```

## üìñ Key Learnings/Takeaways
