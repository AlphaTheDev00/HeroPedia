Superman possesses superhuman strength, speed, and durability. He can fly, has heat vision, freeze breath, and X-ray vision. Beyond his powers, Superman represents hope and embodies the ideal that anyone can use their gifts, whatever they may be, to help others and make the world a better place.`,

Unlike many superheroes, Batman possesses no superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his genius intellect, detective skills, martial arts expertise, and an arsenal of advanced technology and gadgets. His Batsuit provides protection and intimidation, while his vehicles like the Batmobile give him mobility and tactical advantages.`,

The bite gave him superhuman strength, speed, agility, and the ability to cling to walls. He also developed a "spider-sense" that warns him of imminent danger.

After initially using his powers for personal gain, Peter learned a tragic lesson about responsibility when his inaction led to his Uncle Ben's death. Inspired by his uncle's belief that "with great power comes great responsibility," Peter dedicated himself to fighting crime as Spider-Man.`,

After being captured by terrorists and sustaining a severe chest injury, Tony built the first Iron Man suit as a means of escape. The experience changed him profoundly, leading him to redirect Stark Industries away from weapons development and toward clean energy and advanced technology for the greater good.`,
